# Genealogy-Java-Project
The purpose of this project was to create and test multiple methods to help process DNA . Strands of DNA are incredibly large and thus would take forever to process by hand.
The project is to replace the need for a human to sort through and analyse DNA. Large files of DNA can then be easily processed to display certain results in a small time frame.
The testing methods within are used to prove the accuracy of the logic used and boost confidence that DNA will be properly processed with minimal error.
